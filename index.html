            <h1>Model</h1>
            <p class="lead">In this project, we utilized YOLO v8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to predict images for three medical conditions: ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) injuries, meniscal injuries, and osteoarthritis.</p>
            
            <h2>Data Overview</h2>
            <p>We collected a comprehensive dataset comprising:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ACL: Approximately 3000 images</li>
                <li>Meniscal: Over 2000 images</li>
                <li>Osteoarthritis: Over 9000 images</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Model Training</h2>
            <p>The training process involved splitting the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets. We used the training images for model training and adjusted the validation and testing sets accordingly to ensure model generalization.</p>
            
            <h2>Model Evaluation</h2>
            <p>To assess the model's performance, we conducted rigorous evaluations on the test set. The model's scores were determined based on various metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score.</p>
            
            <h2>Model Visualization</h2>
            <p>Below are visualizations of the model's predictions for each medical condition:</p>
            
            
            <h2>Significance of Diseases</h2>
            <p>Each of the diseases targeted by our model—ACL tears, meniscal tears, and osteoarthritis—holds significant clinical importance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ACL Tears:</strong> ACL tears are one of the most common knee injuries, especially among athletes involved in sports that require sudden stops or changes in direction. They can lead to instability in the knee joint and often require surgical intervention followed by extensive rehabilitation.</li>
                <li><strong>Meniscal Tears:</strong> Meniscal tears occur when the cartilage in the knee, known as the meniscus, is damaged, typically due to twisting motions. These injuries can cause pain, swelling, and limited mobility, and they often require surgical repair or removal.</li>
                <li><strong>Osteoarthritis:</strong> Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage and bone within a joint. It is a leading cause of disability worldwide, particularly among older adults. Osteoarthritis can result in chronic pain, stiffness, and reduced quality of life.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By accurately detecting and classifying these conditions, our model can assist healthcare professionals in providing timely diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of patients, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.</p>
